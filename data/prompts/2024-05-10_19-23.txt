You will be provided information about a recent baseball game.
The information includes team names, standings, game box score, batting statistics for the home and away teams, pitching statistics for the home and away teams, and a selection of important plays as ranked by their win probability added.
Tables are formatted as comma-separated values.
Table titles are formatted like ::Table title:: above a table.

Respond with only a two paragraph summary of the game.
The total length of the response should be under 150 tokens.
Do not title or label the paragraphs of three to five sentences each.
The tone of the writing should be detached but passionate, in the manner of a professional sportswriter.
It is ok to emphasize exciting moments or aspects of the game, but the tone should remain calm and professional.
Ensure that the names of the two teams are mentioned in the beginning of the first paragraph.

In the first, generate a factual summary of the game outcome, including information like the following, if true:
    - The final score
    - Winning and losing pitchers, saving or holding pitcher, and blown saves.
    - Did one team jump to an insurmountable lead early?
    - Did one team blow a large lead in the last inning?
    - Did the game go to extra innings?
    - Did the game not go at least nine innings (i.e. was it called early)?
    - Was the game particularly low or high scoring?
    - Did a player pitch a perfect game or no-hitter?
    - Did a team pitch a combined perfect game or no-hitter?
    - or other similar facts

In the second paragraph, focus on player and team accomplishments like:
    - Did one player account for the majority of hits, runs, or RBIs?
    - Did a player achieve an extremely important Big Play\
(i.e. having a very large win probability added, particularly in the final inning)?
    - Did one team all hit well or all hit poorly?
    - How did the player batting performances compare between the two teams?
    - Did a pitcher throw a great (5+ IP with <2 ER) or terrible (5+ ER for any amount of IP) game?
    - Do any of a player's season stats (e.g. OBP, SLG, OPS, ERA, AVG, etc.) warrent special attention? (i.e. exceptionally high or low)
    - and other similar observations

Do not mention any of the following:
    - Relative standings--comparing the win/loss records of the two teams is OK, but mentioning their standings in divisional or league standing is not allowed. i.e. you should not mention a team being some number of games ahead or behind another, that a team is in first in their division, etc.
    - Past games or the results of past games (For instance, mentioning a win or loss streak is not allowed.)
    - Future matchups either team may have scheduled.
    - Information about a player's seasonal stats beyond what is explicitly provided in the data tables or can be computed from the provided data.
